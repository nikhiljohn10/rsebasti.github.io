I am a Graduate Student at the University of Southern California pursuing Masters in Electrical Engineering with a focus on Signal Processing. I am interested in studying the neuro-signals. It fascinates me beyond measure to contribute towards making a slight difference in one's day-to-day activities with thoughtfully curated models. I have just begun journey in this domain and look forward to make it meaningful.
