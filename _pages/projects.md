# Research Projects
## MRI SuperResolution Problem                                 *Summer 2018*
- Reviewed computational algorithms to enhance low resolution MRIs to detect/segment lesions in 200 sickle cell children.
- Incorporated image quality metrics to examine reconstructed super-resolution images using Low Rank Total Variation algorithm.

# Course Projects
## Sit-to-Stand-to-Step Modeling                               *Fall 2017*
- Employed Monte Carlo Simulation to analyze experimental data experimental data collected in laboratory using motion capture camera system during sit-to-stand-to-step task.
- Determined minimum number of lower extremity muscles needed to produce by optimizing sum of vertical Ground Reaction Force for task and compared results using Pareto analysis of sum of vGRF production of 16 muscle groups.
## Object removal and infilling                                *Fall 2017*
- Designed and implemented code to remove undesirable objects from any color image.
- Filled void area with candidate patches based on exemplar inpainting algorithm by minimizing sum of square distance (SSD) of neighbouring patch and candidate patch to preserve continuity of structures in image
